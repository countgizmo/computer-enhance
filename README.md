## Compute Enhance (The Homework)

I'm bad at doing homework. Always was, always will be.
But this time the homework is interesting. So I am stuck at the first
part for waaay too long just cause I want to try different approach, make sure
I get it, etc.

Anyway, I don't know why this is a public repository, but it is even though there's nothing here
for the public.

P.S. I don't know Zig, so DO NOT use this code as educational or inspirational material. If you clone it
and try to compile it it just might make your computer explode. You have been warned.
